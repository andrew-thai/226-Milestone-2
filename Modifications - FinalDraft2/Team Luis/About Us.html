      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p><b>CARHDS is a unique service as it is the only training and development organisation in Central Australia whose primary focus is on remote health services </b><br/></br></br>

      Australian Company Number: 098 256 387 </br></br>
      RTO National Provider Number: 70018 </br></br></br>

      CARHDS is an incorporated public company limited by guarantee and a Registered Training Organisation (RTO). It has transferred to the Australian Charities and Not for Profit Commission (ACNC)
      Over the past 15 years CARHDS has built up the expertise, experience and relationships which have proven critical to effective in-service training. Membership is open to all existing, new and emerging organisations that provide Primary Health Care services to Aboriginal communities.
      The main objective of CARHDS is to develop the capacity of Aboriginal people and health professionals to improve community health outcomes and to increase effective Aboriginal control over PHC service delivery.
      The strength of the CARHDS model is that it is industry and employer driven and directly accountable to the PHC services for outcomes. The benefits are immediately experienced in the health centres and health clinics.
      CARHDS believes that unless people regain control over their lives their health does not improve. Education and Training must; Build on the people's capacity to take control.
      Be provided in a way that the people can control.
      Be delivered in a way that strengthens the local organisational context within which communities can express their aspirations."</br></br></br>
